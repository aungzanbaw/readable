# Readable project, build a content and comment web app 
Udacity React & Redux project

## How to install and Start
To get started right away:
* Readable Clientside, the application requires only `npm install` then `npm start` to install dependencies and launch.

* Readable API Server, get the API source code from [Github](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)
    * `cd api-server`
    * `npm install`
    * `npm start`
API server will start at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)

## Features
* Most application state is managed by the Redux store. State-based props are mapped from the store rather than stored as component state.
* Form inputs and controlled components may have some state handled by the component.
* Updates are triggered by dispatching action creators to reducers.
* Reducers and actions are written properly and correctly return updated state to the store.
